`impl Days` is the sibling event of RustFest&lt;Rome&gt;. `impl Days` is a full-day event for Rust contributors to
collaborate in an active programming session. It will take place on the two days following the RustFest talks and
workshops, on {{site.dates.impl_days_no_br}} {{site.dates.year}}.

## History

Born as a hacking and development experiment in the early RustFest editions, the "impl Days" has established as a
tradition following each RustFest.

The name refers to the first edition that took place during the 2017 "impl Period", therefore the name "impl Days" was a
natural choice.  <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/the-impl-period-newsletter-2/6034"> Over those two days</a>,
30 to 40 people came together to discuss, design, and implement changes to Rust itself as well its broader ecosystem.

Plus, <a href="https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust-internals/2017-10-02/?msg=91818378&page=2">they got to build a Lego Death
Star</a>.

The Zurich `impl Days` was such a success that we decided to repeat the event in Paris and it was an even <a

The event location(s) will be announced at a later stage.

`impl Days` is a great chance to work directly with other Rust enthusiasts. The Rust project is supported by volunteers
across the globe, and while we often rely on github comments and IRC channels for communication, the face-to-face
communication enabled by an event like this can be a big productivity boost.

You may be just starting out as a Rust contributor, or you may be a long-time compiler hacker who reminisces about the
days when Rust was bootstrapped atop ML. Either way, there's plenty of tasks for all contributors at `impl Days`.

You do not need to buy a separate ticket for `impl Days`; your Rust Fest ticket will suffice.

Thus, everyone who plans to attend `impl Days` should tell us explicitly on the online questionnaire built into the
RustFest ticket.

## What will happen at the `impl Days`?

Schedule about the Impl Days will announced when details will be finalized.

The general idea is to arrive at the location around 9:00 AM, then there will be a headcount and some time spent getting
to know each other, finally identify tasks for participants to collaborate on.  Each of the two `impl Days` will start
winding down at around 5 PM. All participants must leave the venue premises each day by around 6 PM. Exact time tables
will be announced later. Further details will be finalized at a later stage.

* People can freely work on their own with headphones or form little groups. There

* Participants are free to arrive later and depart earlier than the schedule specified above.

* Like in past editions of the Impls Days, participants are of course free to leave to enjoy the city for a nice walk in one of the world's most renowned capital

Lacking ideas or suggestions for projects to work on? No problem!

* "good first issue" is a popular label for many Rust core repositories, ancillary tooling and crates as well - some examples: [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue) or have a look [here](https://www.rustaceans.org/findwork/starters) and [here](https://github.com/RustBeginners/please/issues).

* Issues triaging

* Documentation: many crates are in need of a bare `README.md` or some usage examples in the `examples` directory.

Most of all participants should enjoy the Impl Days without any pressure or accomplishment requirement. If your final result for the Impl Days is a better understanding of the Rust world and having met some cool folks to keep in touch with, well - that's a fantastic result either! ðŸŽŠ

More detailed plans will be done on-the-fly at the `impl Days` itself, based on the skill sets of the people who show
up to contribute.
