    An electronic technician by training, I switched careers for I found software development more interesting and accessible (more cheap to practice, and more free learning resources). I've been in Python ecosystem for a number of years and have now switched to Rust for some reason. I've done quiet a bit of doc work for both ecosystems, and some code contributions. I would like to be a solid developer some day.
