RustFest is an inclusive conference and as such strives to be accessible to everyone. This includes:

* Offering significantly discounted tickets for concession holders.
* Ensuring all our venues are accessible by wheelchair.
* Live transcription of all talks.
    - Appropriate measures can be taken for the workshop day and the impl days. Please get in touch.
* Making sure that maps and orientation material is available.
* Providing clear signage to, from and through the building
* Providing quiet spaces for those with sensory issues.
* Providing accessibility for conference sessions.
* Providing complimentary tickets for assistants for those with disabilities.
* Access to non-gendered toilets.
    - This is sometimes subject to the venues rules, but we do our best to ensure this.
    - If not, we expect people not to complain about others choice of toilet.
* Serving a wide range of food and special requests.
* An all-around help hotline during the time of the conference.
* Providing 5 tickets specifically through [diversityticket.org](https://diversitytickets.org).

If you’re not sure whether the concession rate should apply to you, please do get in touch.

Our goal is that the conference and workshops and all other related events are accessible to people with disabilities. However, we are aware that accessibility issues are diverse and we may not have everything covered off in our plans - please reach out, and we will do our very best to confirm we have those requirements under control. Send a mail to [team@rustfest.eu](mailto:team@rustfest.eu).

We will happily reserve you a ticket if it’s not immediately clear whether necessary assistance is provided or you have additional planning to do for your trip to RustFest.
