## Grants

We give out travel and attendance grants to FOSS contributors. These often take the form of tickets and travel grants. Usually, these take the form of a campaign, such as the [libz blitz grant](https://blog.rustfest.eu/libz-blitz). We also assist project contributors to come to RustFest in other ways, for example by finding sponsors for them.

## impl days

After RustFest, there's usually `impl days`. Kicked off as an idea from the Rust project, we meet after the conference for usually 2 days in the form of a large hackfest. `impl days` are usually smaller than the conference and happen at other venues, but spawn new projects or learning experiences!
