title: Commandline Applications in Rust
special:
desc: >
    In the beginning of 2018, the CLI working group was announced. Its mission: making the development of command line applications in Rust easier, more scalable and involving less boilerplate. Now, we're nearing the end of the year. In this talk we will review some of the progress that was made, and show how the process of writing a command-line application in Rust looks from 2018 onward.
