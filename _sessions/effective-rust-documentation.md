title: Effective Rust Documentation
desc: >
  While Rust and its ecosystem has some shining examples of great documentation, there's still a lot to do. So let's spread the word how to improve all our crates' docs. Because they deserve it.
  <br>
  This is a "bring your own crate" workshop, so please select a crate you want to document or improve documentation on. For those undecided, I will maintain a list of "docs wanted" crates during the talks day to distribute crates randomly.
