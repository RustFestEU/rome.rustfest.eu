title: Build a blockchain runtime in Rust with Parity Substrate
desc: >
    We will build an application, complete with demo UI that runs on its own blockchain. We will start by writing a runtime module for the Parity Substrate, compiling it to WASM and then swapping it using the Substrate client, then interacting with it from the UI. From there we will explore the options of building our own native client with the same module, making sure the two are compatible. This workshop will include a brief introduction to Substrate, and blockchain in general. No specific knowledge of crypto is strictly necessary, however somewhat intermediate familiarity with Rust might be.
