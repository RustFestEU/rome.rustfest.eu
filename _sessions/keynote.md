title: Grappling with growth, and other good problems to have
special: Keynote
desc: >
  On the eve of Rust 2018, we have so much to celebrate! From the core language to tools to community outreach to adoption, the Rust project has made enormous strides. But with success comes new challenges. Looking ahead to the next Edition of Rust, this keynote will lay out some of these challenges along three dimensions: Stakeholders, Governance, and Product. I'll pitch some personal ideas for how to grapple with these challenges, taking a frank look at what's working well and what needs to change, and inviting community-wide discussion as we go into our planning for next year.
