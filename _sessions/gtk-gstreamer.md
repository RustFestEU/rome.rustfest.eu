title: GTK and GStreamer
desc: >
  In this workshop we will go through the basics of using the GTK+ UI toolkit and the GStreamer multimedia framework from Rust. A small webcam desktop application will be written during the course of the workshop, which will allow to view the video from the webcam, take snapshots and record videos, possibly with effects.
  <br>
  If you're interested in either of the two technologies and how to use them from Rust then this is the workshop for you.
  <br>
  Basic Rust knowledge is a requirement for this workshop and participants should bring a laptop with a webcam, running Linux, macOS, or Windows, or pair with another participant on their laptop.
