title: Fun with Rusty Robots
special:
desc: >
    Lately as a hobby I am participating to robotic competitions where autonomous robots fight according to various rules (usually speed races or Sumo fights). Lately I am putting Rust into every robot I program, from bare metal (arduino-like AVR and ARM Cortex-M), to Linux on higher level boards (Raspberry PI, Beaglebone), and even on a real time OS running on the Lego Mindstorm ARM-v5 CPU. In this talk I'll show embedded Rust programming in all of these environments, with a focus on getting things done!
