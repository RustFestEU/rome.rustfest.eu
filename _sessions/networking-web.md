title: Networking & Web
desc: >
    Join Yann (Founder, 1aim), Hoverbear (Engineer, PingCAP) and fellow attendees in an ad-hoc space to present and discuss your latest research and experiments in the fields of networking, radio, routing/infrastructure, chaos testing, service discovery, encoding, monitoring, instrumentation, and distributed computing.


    How do Tokio reactors work? What are the pitfalls of UTF-8? What are useful design patterns for transactional requests? How can we greater leverage futures? How can we ensure our system behaves as we expect? How can we feel comfortable destroying database nodes in production? How do IMAP and SMTP work anyways?


    You are encouraged to bring less than 15 minutes worth of content, a project, or a research paper you find interesting. All attendees will be invited to both ask for a topic to be covered, and present on any topic of interest to the group. Participation is voluntary, of course.


    Together, let's architect the future.
