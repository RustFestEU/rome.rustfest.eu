title: "Sequoia: A New OpenPGP Implementation in Rust"
special:
desc: >
    OpenPGP is best known for its use in email encryption. But, OpenPGP
    is, perhaps more importantly, used to secure software updates, sign
    commits, and protect backups.

    Historically, OpenPGP has been hard for both end-users and developers
    to use--we know, we actually worked on GnuPG! In Sequoia, we are
    trying to change that. Sequoia is a new OpenPGP implementation that
    places as much emphasis on usability as on security.

    Sequoia is also written in Rust. This talk will focus on the challenges that
    we've faced using Rust--infinite types, streaming iterators, designing a clean
    API--and our solutions.
