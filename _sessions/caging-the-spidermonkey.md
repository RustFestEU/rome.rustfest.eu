title: Caging the SpiderMonkey - Ensuring safe JS bindings in Servo
special:
desc: >
    This talk will focus on some of the challenges encountered while working on integrating SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine with the Servo web browser engine (written in C++ and Rust, respectively). We will explore how Rust's rich type system made it possible to enforce many Servo–SpiderMonkey interface rules and safety considerations at compile time and how a custom compiler plugin was developed to verify against project-specific errors at a language level.
