  RustBridge is an all-day workshop focused on getting underrepresented people with a background in another programming language to learn Rust and join the community. In this workshop weâ€™ll get you up and running with a Rust development environment, introduce you to Rust syntax and programming concepts, and work together to build a small website that you can personalize, extend, and share!
