title: Diversity at RustFest
---

RustFest is one of the biggest Rust conferences and takes Rusts mission for an inclusive community seriously. This is based on multiple pillars.

## People-first budgeting

RustFests aims to have an affortable ticket price, while keeping a good quality of the conference. We're the cheapest and longest Rust Conference, with our ticket price fixed around 100 Euros and rebated tickets available. The ticket price is focused around a single principle: If RustFest had no sponsors, it would happen.

Despite not always guaranteed, historically, we payed the full expenses of our speakers and organisers for the last RustFests. We always pay in full for people that can't afford otherwise.

Budget overruns are often invested into community efforts or kept around for the next edition.

## Above-average diversity efforts

The last RustFests have had a sizable amount of diversity tickets. In contrast to many other conferences, we started to pay full travel and hotel lodging for the first set of tickets. This includes intercontinental travel. On request, we pre-pay the travel.

It is important to us that diversity ticket holders have no issues attending and for a conference of our price range, travel is often more prohibitive than tickets.

## Disability-Minded

When talking about diversity efforts in IT, disability is often forgotten. We believe this needs to change. RustFest has always had an [accessibility statement](/accessibility/) with proper, upfront documentation. Our efforts are cross-checked and implemented with actually disabled people. RustFest always has a responsible person for accessibility efforts.

RustFest appreciates that disability is diverse and will work with you directly to solve all of your needs. We will actively work on the issue together with you.

## Choice of caterer

We always ensure our caterers can serve proper vegetarian and vegan meals and can cater to special requests. We also cater other needs. If possible, we search for catering that is built around these options, as we found it the easiest way to provide a good quality to all at scale.

Requests are handled quickly and we up to now only had one request we couldn't serve.

Please note that due to RustFest being a travelling conference, we can only ever work with a caterer once, which still leaves an element of variance.

## No alcohol on conference budget

RustFest has a strict rule around free alcohol: there is none. This includes refusing offers from sponsors for some. We found during previous conferences that offering free alcohol contributes to an aggressive party culture, as people would drink for free and _then_ buy some more.

Please note that some fringe events of the conference may have alcohol on sale, but we check that there's always affortable and good non-alcoholic options and enough space to avoid drunk people.

## No debates

We have processes for dealing with a lot of things that are tiny issues for us, but big ones for you.

We don't ask for proof and always assume good intentions when approaching us with a request. RustFest is here for _you_ to have a good time, and if you have any kind of need, we'll do our best to help you.

We trust you and so far had a great experience with that.

## We strive for constant improval

The Rust community is young and RustFest is a young project. We're happy to take any feedback about (this and previous) RustFests at any time. Please contact us at [team@rustfest.eu](mailto:team@rustfest.eu) around that.

If you see an something that can be improved, please let us know! We will care about it. If it happens to be a thing that you _like_ working on, please also approach us for becoming part of the team. We appreciate that solutions are not always for free and will always try to provide effort as well as a budget for your task.
