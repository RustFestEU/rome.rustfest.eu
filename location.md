Rome, the eternal city, is the capital of Italy with 3 million of residents. It's located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio, along the shores of the Tiber. 
Rome's history spans 28 centuries, leaving behind a huge number of monuments spanning from the famous Colosseum, to Piazza Di Spagna and Fontana Di Trevi.
Also the Vatican City is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.
